# Ame Nguyen Portfolio

> I am enthusiastic to chase after the constantly evolving arms race that is cybersecurity. I strongly believe in the reliability of the system enabling seamless workflow for the rest of an organization. I strongly believe that cybersecurity should become a pillar of reliability, one people could fully rely on to never falter. Including times of crisis caused by either internal or external factors. I value a strong security posture and decisiveness in taking action to safeguard assets, and the ability to do so quickly without impacting other operations.
